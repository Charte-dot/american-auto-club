# Ux Design Stage

 I started with designing how the site will look first. Using balasmiq wireframe, I plotted out how each page should be presented and a guide to how the individual site pages will be presented. I used this method to work out how best to list the navigational buttons. This wireframe template gave me the general pattern of how the layout site will look eventually. From this template I now can build and style my site using the wireframe as a guide, helping to keep my website design and layout as envisioned. The original name on the site for the club was The v8's Authentic american auto club. But during design phase this was shortened to The Authentic American Auto Club for aesthetics and to fit in with the overall design.
