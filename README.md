## Ux Design Stage

![Wireframe image](media/Wireframe-image.jpg)

I started with designing how the site will look first. Using balasmiq wireframe, I plotted out how each page should be presented and a guide to how the individual site pages will be presented. I used this method to work out how best to list the navigational buttons. This wireframe template gave me the general pattern of how the layout site will look eventually. From this template I now can build and style my site using the wireframe as a guide, helping to keep my website design and layout as envisioned.
